New category, yay!

So, I configured automatic update of this blog when I write new post - it is run on Github pages, deployed by Github actions and the different categories are
their own repositories, which are included as submodules and necessary files for Jekyll symlinked to correct places. So - as the actual posts are in their own
repos, I had to update the submodules separately, until now! Created another workflow to the master repo, which pulls latest versions of all submodules and
commits them to the repo, which then triggers the site update dpeloyment workflow. That update workflow is in turn triggered by submodule workflow through API.
Nice :3 Makes writing here easy as I don't need to fiddle around to publish the posts - just write them and add the metadata to entry-yaml :3 And yes, I know
this is overly complicated way of doing things but I didn't have place to write blog-like content and this felt the easiest approach at the time. "Sysadmin
being sysadmin" x)

I have been extremely busy lately and that has made a dent to my mental health. I have slept really badly, which has caused brain to compensate and ignore alarms
which is causing issues at work as even while we have flexible work hours, working around the same time as everyone else is strongly adviced. And I have TTRPG
campaings to attend to so I haven't been able to stretch the worksdays from the other end. And that has caused it's own share of stress 😅. The games haven't
been as fun either and relaxing has been hard. I have tried too hard basically as there also was our theatre play which took a lot but gave even more. Problem
with that was that it took from my physical coping and gave to mental. And that ain't sustainable!

But, I'm in better shape now, I'm actually able to do things I want and love, they are passion projects after all. One of the huge positive things was Vectorama,
that bunch of people are so precious to me 💜. The vast majority of the organizers are neurodivergent - me included, so it feels like home. I can goof around
and don't have to think so much about the social norms. It's so relazing. I'm actually travelling home from Oulu while writing this as the LAN party was three
weeks ago and now was the funeral parties of that. I wish I could see them more often.

There's many other friends in Tampere and Helsinki I also would like to meet again - I'm super wary of asking anything from others, so if the friends won't
contact me, I don't contact them. <sub>ADHD, rejection sensitive dysphoria and other things says hello 👋🏻</sub> I really should just stop being overly
emphatic and just throw them with a message that I would like to have a coffee with them. Maybe at some point, I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️.

Anyways, I think I might write here more often than what I used to write to my [transition blog](https://transwoman-voyage.blogspot.com), as this is more
free-form and I don't have to anonymize so much - transition blog anonymizes even me! "Knowers knows" etc. Here I can even create glossary about obfuscated
names of people I reference x) (that is actually so great idea that I will do that right after publishing this)

So, stay tuned! 'Til next time 💜
