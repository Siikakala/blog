It indeed has been a moment or two. A lot has happened during the past one and half years. Dad moved to nursing home and the house was sold, my grandma died, I got fired and re-employed by other company, I bought my first own home, some surgery, painful migraines and other fun stuff too.

So, I have now lost all my grandparents. My grandma was really demented already so I feel like she got away. Her whole, almost 100 years long life was just one huge day and converstaions with her was really hard. I didn't even visit her much, on purpose, to leave happier last memories. It might be bit cruel but I want to protect my own mind. I have it hard enough already myself.

My dad also decided that it's too cumbersome to live in a house in the health state he is currently, requested and granted to be moved to nursing home. Quite a change from almost 100mÂ² house to 10mÂ² room. But at least he got some company in the nursing home, so he won't be so lonely as that was also one of the problems. And, the house was sold, rather quickly I'd say, and I got quarter of it as well - my part of my mother's heritage.

Thanks to the heritages of my mom and grandmom, I bought apartment close by where I lived previously. I have oogled this apartment for a long time already and have watched the building to rise and finally got the opportunity to buy it. It's teeny tine bit smaller than the last place but the floorplan is way better so it doesn't feel any bit smaller - almost the opposite. Though moving is cumbersome and expensive, I hope I can live here for a long time. We'll see how it goes.

I also got fired from my old company about a year a go as a result of cooperation negotiations. Those feeled forced from the upper management so it was really hard for my closest superior. But, when your hands are tied, what you do. At least it was the subsidiary CEO who did the laundry but it was hard for him too - I haven't had seen him cry ever before. Anyway, ex-colleague sent a message shortly after the lay-offs and I had a job shortly after. Bit different aspect of the same work I did and senior position with better pay and great colleagues, really can't complain.

I can complain about my migraine though - I had the worst migraine spiral of my life: 20 attacks in 21 days and I even got into emergency room due to it. Just to have IV medication coctail in attempt to stop the spiral. Achievement unlocked I guess? Not a one I would liked to unlock though. Fortunately not apoplexy, the situation was bad enough that it was a possibility. I'm still recovering from it, but the situation is much better already, only some premonitions, no pain anymore. Though extreme light sensitivy is extremely annoying premonition!

What else.. Right, I got into SRS part 2, where they fixed some problems left behind from the first round - they had to wait to everything to properly settle down before they could even see what was the problem. But that is fixed now, and it was the most annoying thing too, I'm happy to the results now!

I also added new module to the site - it's kind of a sister module for fanfiction: DnD! There's just one character for now but I might write about the adventures at some point. Could be fun side project to write those~
